## 🤔 What Are "Skills"?

Think of skills as **specialized instruction manuals** for AI coding assistants. 

**Simple analogy:** Just like you might hire different experts (a designer, a security expert, a marketer), these skills let your AI assistant become an expert in specific areas when you need them.

## 📦 What's Inside This Repository?

## How Do Skills Work?

### Step 1: Install Skills
Copy the skills to your AI tool's directory:

```bash
# For most AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

### Step 2: Use a Skill
In your AI chat, mention the skill:

```
@brainstorming help me design a todo app
```

or

```
/stripe-integration add payment processing to my app

### Step 3: The AI Becomes an Expert
The AI loads that skill's knowledge and helps you with specialized expertise!

## Your First Skill: A Quick Example

Let's try the **brainstorming** skill:

1. **Open your AI assistant** (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

2. **Type this:**
   ```
   @brainstorming I want to build a simple weather app
   ```

3. **What happens:**
   - The AI loads the brainstorming skill
   - It asks you questions one at a time
   - It helps you design the app before coding
   - It creates a design document for you

4. **Result:** You get a well-thought-out plan instead of jumping straight to code!
